11136773-task 4/ ReadMe.

Task 1...
In this task, I created a function that takes the arrays that we get and modifies these arrays to a certain degree.
What we did after defining the function was that we got the array in question. we then run a for loop for the length of the array.
if the number turned out to be divisible by 2 without a remainder, we square the number, or rather, multiply it by itself.
else we just multiply the number by 3.

Task 2...
in this task, we modify the first part of the assignment. we allow a string to be passed into the array and allow this string to be then modified based on the index of the array.
we do this by running a function.
if it is even, it is Capitalized
if it is odd, then it is changed to lowercase.'

Task 3...
Firstly, we created a new file and named it.
Next, we created a function.
This function takes names and creates an array of modified names from task 2.
this functions returns 3 things. 
it returns,an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and ID.
